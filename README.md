## JZ RESOURCE HUB

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) web application by me [@Jenzone](https://jensoncaparida.me). A personal collection of tools, resources, guides and links to enhance productivity and streamline workflows. It's a one-stop hub for everything I use to stay organized, efficient, and continuously learning.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
